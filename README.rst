# Oxygen2 â€“ Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring System

This embedded system project is designed to monitor water quality in real-time, targeting use cases such as the transportation and welfare monitoring of wild salmon and sea trout. It retrieves, parses, and displays data from an **Aanderaa Oxygen Optode 4531 sensor** using a **nRF52 microcontroller**.

## âœ… Features Implemented

- âœ… **UART Integration** with Oxygen Optode sensor using MAX3232 IC  
- âœ… **Live display of:**
  - Oxygen concentration (in ÂµM)
  - Air saturation (in %)
  - Temperature (in Â°C)
- âœ… **Data parsing** and formatting from noisy UART input  
- âœ… **Display integration** using ST7565R-compatible 128x64 LCD  
- âœ… **Real-time data shown on both terminal and LCD**

## ðŸ“ˆ Sensor Details

The Aanderaa Oxygen Optode sensor provides:
- **O2 Concentration** in ÂµM  
- **Air Saturation** in %  
- **Temperature** in Â°C  

These values are critical for assessing fish health and stress levels during transport. In future work, ÂµM concentration will be converted to mg/L for regulatory compliance and comparison with scientific literature.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate **wireless communication** (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
- [ ] Add **buzzer/LED alerts** for unsafe thresholds
- [ ] Include **turbidity sensor** and process its readings
- [ ] Measure **power consumption** using Nordic Power Profiler Kit
- [ ] Add **remote threshold adjustment** and basic calibration UI
- [ ] Expand to log data for future cloud/database upload
